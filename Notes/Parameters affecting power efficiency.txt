Parameters affecting power efficiency:
1. Transmission power
2. Node density
3. Communication Range
4. Residual Energy of Nodes
5. Packet Size
6. Network Topology
7. Link Quality

Transmission Power:
	The amount of power a device uses to transmit data directly affects energy consumption.

Node Density:
	The number of nodes in the network influences the routing efficiency and overall power consumption.

Communication Range:
	The distance over which a device can communicate with another impacts transmission power.

Residual Energy of Nodes:
	The remaining energy in each node is a critical factor in determining the routing path to ensure longevity and energy efficiency of the network.

Packet Size:
	The size of the data packets being transmitted affects the power consumption during communication.

Network Topology:
	The arrangement of nodes and their connections impacts the routing decisions and thus the energy efficiency of the network.

Link Quality:
	The reliability and stability of the communication link between nodes can influence retransmissions and consequently power usage.
